# SPACE SNAKE

SEIRFX 621 - PROJECT 1

### INSTRUCTIONS
This is the classic game of Snake, but Space Edition! Use the arrow keys - up, down, left, and right to move the snake to collect as many stars as possible! But be careful...don't run into any walls or crash into yourself or it will be game over!

### WIRE FRAME
I started with a wire frame to get an idea of how I wanted my game layout to look.
